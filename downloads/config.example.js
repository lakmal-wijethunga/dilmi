// How to get Google Drive File IDs:
// 1. Right-click on your file in Google Drive
// 2. Select "Get link" or "Share"
// 3. Set permission to "Anyone with the link can view"
// 4. Copy the link - it will look like:
//    https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74mHmrEqpUBb/view?usp=sharing
// 5. Extract the FILE_ID (the long string between /d/ and /view):
//    1BxiMVs0XRA5nFMdKvBdBZjgmUUqptlbs74mHmrEqpUBb

// TMDB (The Movie Database) API for getting movie information
// Sign up at https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api for free API key

};

// Example function to fetch movie data from TMDB
function fetchMovieFromTMDB(movieTitle) {
    // This is an example - you can implement this to auto-populate movie data
    const searchUrl = `${tmdbConfig.baseUrl}/search/movie?api_key=${tmdbConfig.apiKey}&query=${encodeURIComponent(movieTitle)}`;
    
    // Use fetch to get movie data and auto-populate the movie object
    // This can help you quickly get posters, cast, ratings, etc.
}
